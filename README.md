# Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game implemented using Python and the Turtle graphics library.
The game features a snake controlled by the player, and the goal is to navigate the snake to eat food and grow longer without colliding with the walls or its own tail.

## Features

- Single-player gameplay: The game is designed for single-player mode, where the player controls the snake using keyboard inputs.
- Snake movement: The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The player can control the snake's movement using the arrow keys.
- Food generation: The game randomly generates food on the screen. The snake needs to eat the food to grow longer and score points.
- Score tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, displaying it on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, the score increases.
- Collision detection: The game detects collisions between the snake and the walls or its own tail. If the snake collides with any of these obstacles, the game ends.
- High score record: The game records and displays the player's highest score. The high score is saved in a data file and updated when a new high score is achieved.

## How to Play

1. Run the game: Launch the Python script to start the game.
2. Player controls: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right) to control the snake's movement. Navigate the snake to eat the food and avoid collisions with the walls or its own tail.
3. Gameplay: The snake will start moving in the initial direction. Guide the snake to eat the food and grow longer. Each time the snake eats food, the score will increase, and the snake's length will extend.
4. Collision detection: If the snake collides with the walls or its own tail, the game ends. The final score will be displayed on the screen.
5. High score: The game keeps track of the player's highest score. The high score is saved in a data file and updated when a new high score is achieved.
6. Restarting the game: After the game ends, you can choose to restart and play again.
